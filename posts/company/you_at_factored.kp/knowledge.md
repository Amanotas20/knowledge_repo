# You @ Factored

### **Welcome!!!** **We are so very proud to have you join our Factored team.**

Together, we will continue to build this company and provide the world with the exceptional engineering and analytics talent that it needs and deserves. We have already provided complex solutions to real-world problems experienced by some of the largest companies on the planet, and some of the most interesting startups in Silicon Valley. Our team of engineers used to joke about the top 3%, and now that distinction is proving to be ever more real. Beyond test results, our clients vote with their actions by extending contracts and hiring more engineers and analysts. We get selected by rigorous clients who come from prestigious institutions such as Google, Harvard, and Stanford, to name a few.

More importantly, Factored makes a real positive contribution to Latin America, and the world. We find talented engineers and analysts and give them the opportunity to blossom  into evermore confident AI and data science experts, helping LATAM create vibrant tech hubs with value-added tech businesses (for far too long, our countries have only been considered exporters of natural resources). I once read that for every job we create, 5-10 additional jobs are created in the local economy. 

Moreover, this is only the very beginning of our impact because our commitment to giving back  to our community is genuine. It’s more than words on a website; we all feel a strong sense of responsibility to give back and will continue to invest our time and efforts into creating opportunities for many others.

***Let’s keep building Factored as a team that is proud of the work we do and the impact we make. Let’s create a company where we can all do the best and most satisfying work of our lives.***

Thank you for being part of this!

**Israel Niezen, CEO**
