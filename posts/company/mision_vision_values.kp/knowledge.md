# Mission, Vision, and Values @ Factored

If you ask what keeps Factored Alive, you can always be referred back to the core of **what we do (our mission)**, **our wildest aspirations (Our vision)**, and our **company values.** Here they are:

### **Mission**

To build the highest-caliber AI, Data Science & Machine Learning engineering teams and deliver impactful solutions for our customers.

### **Vision**

To build a world-class company that makes a valuable contribution to our team, our customers, and our communities. To put Latin America on the Global stage for AI and Data Science Talent.

### **Values:**

*Put Customer First, always:* 

Learn, provide feedback, and iterate so we become trusted and respected as part of our partner’s teams. We are an extension of their teams, not outsiders or vendors.

*Honesty and Transparency:*

We value direct and transparent conversations. We invite you to always speak the truth and share opinions openly. Gossip ruins teams.

*Take Ownership:*

We invite you to feel ownership of our company when making decisions. We are all CEOs of our respective projects and tasks, no matter how small. We are not just employees, we are partners. We are a **team.**

*Deliver Rigor and Excellence, Never Be Mediocre:*

Mediocre people build mediocre companies. We are not mediocre. Strive for Excellence. Expect it and enforce it within our team.

*Execution-Focused Meritocracy:*

Best ideas win, but ideas and opinions without supporting data or execution aren’t worth much. Be diligent in supporting and executing good ideas.
